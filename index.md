<h2>Background:<h2>
<p>
My name is Jade, and I have a keen interest in IT, specifically in security. 
<p>
I grew up in a time where computers and the internet were only just getting off the ground. It was in my teens that I developed a love for the internet and all its components. 
<p>
I completed my year 10 school certificate in 2000 and recently completed Cert II in IT at my local Tafe.
<p>
I have grown to enjoy baking and decorating cakes as a hobby for my family. Their requests for birthday cakes have gotten more extravagant as the years pass!

<h2> Interests in IT</h2>
</p>
It was only in recent years that I discovered that I had a knack for computers/IT. At the same time, I found that I enjoyed finding faults in tech gadgets and in online games. 
<p>
I feel that IT is the future in all aspects from Schooling to the Medical world to the political world. By jumping on board now, I can be secure in the knowledge that there will always be work for me.
<p>
I found RMIT through OUA and I decided to go through them because of their Cyber Security course. I thought they offered a great course and Iâ€™m currently completing more courses in the lead up to the cyber security course later this year.
<p>
I hope to broaden my IT knowledge by stepping out of my comfort zone and diving into my studies.
